# The booklet

Welcome to the home page of the "Hitchiker’s guide to the PhD". Let's start with a good news:

 * 74% of french doctorates are satisfied/very satisfied with their thesis. [@0]

But:

 * 24% of international doctorates meet the symptoms to be classified as clinically depressed. [@1]
 * 33% of 1877 french doctorates have been depressed [@2]
 * 54% of french doctorates are exposed to stress [@0]
 * 36,1 % out of 2100 french doctorates recognize having been victim of moral harassment or psychological violence. [@23]

The situation is dire, and we need to spread awareness on this subject. In France, less than a third (30,1%) of PhD students consider to be well informed on all those issues [@23], time to change this!

This is the goal of this booklet, among other things. The booklet in pdf version can be found [here](booklet/booklet-web.pdf):

* If you are a PhD student, read it!
* If you are an advisor, read it!
* And otherwise, read it!

For a ready to print two-sided version, see [here](booklet/booklet-print.pdf).

Below are all the sources that were used to make it. (to note, there is a mix of scientific and non-scientific studies, but in some cases, the lack of scientific studies is a bad sign).

Feel free to share and spread the booklet! I also encourage you to build on it or make feedback, it is freely accessible and editable [here]()!

# Sources of the PhD booklet

If you were interested in the booklet, below is the list of all the statistics and sources used to make it.


## It's not your fault, part 1: any phd is hard

The bullet points and style are mostly inspired from Dr Zoe Ayres "Toxic Mix" [posters](https://www.zjayres.com/posters). Some references are new.

* Culture of silence: 
    * barely 8% of french doctorates say they have been well warned and taught about mental health risks, and 15% says a little bit. [@0]
    * at conferences, 66,9 % of victims do not make any report. [@23]

* overwork: 
  * 50% of internatioal phd student work over 50h/week [@20],
  
* Impostor syndrom: 
    * 50.6% of Ph.D. students in a belgian University believed they suffer from IP [@22]
    
* financial concerns:
    * 44% of french doctorates under contracts and 49% of those with a grant have an insufficant salary that at least sometimes put them in a difficult position. [@0] (the statistic in [@0] is phrased in the opposite direction)

* no more tick boxes, only open questions now?

* first time failing?

* competitive landscape: no two thesis are the same, comparing is often useless?

* paper please:
    * 65% of researchers indicated they were under tremendous pressure to publish papers [@19]
    
* isolation:
     * 29% of french doctorates suffer from isolation [@0]

* culture of suffering: 
     * 42% of PhD students claimed that developing a mental health issue over the course of their research was considered “normal”. [@21]
  
* difficult relationship/bad advisor: 
    * 25% of international phd students would restart with a different adivsor [@20]

* bad career advertisement: 
  * 36% of french doctorates are worried about their careers [@0]
  * 29% of international phd given usefull career adivce [@20]
  * 50% of international phd don't feel they can talk about not pursuing academia [@20]
  * ~10% at most of french doctorates will get a permanent position: ~14/15k thesis are delivered per year between 2014-2019, ~400 CR position at "EPST" (research centers) [@8], and 1106 "MCF" (associate professor) positions open in 2021. [@9]
  * ~17,5% at most of french computer science doctorates will, with 933 thesis defended in 2023 [@10], 8 CR at CNRS, 9 CR at INRIA, 17 ISFP (non civil servant permanent positions) Inria, 130 MCF at section 27 -> big fluctuations every year.
  

## It's not your fault, part 2: inequalities


* 0,7% of UK university prof are black [@3], vs 3,3% of global population [@4]
     => UK university prof are 5 times less likely to be black
* 28% of UK university prof are women [@3], (vs 50%...)
     => UK university prof are 1.8 times less likely to be women
   The situation is similar in France, where 27% of French University proffesors are women [@8] and 40% of french researchers are women [@8].
* US faculty are up to 25 times more likely to have a parent with a Ph.D [@5], and 20% of french doctorates have a close relative with a phd, while only 1,15% of the population has a thesis. [@0]
* Working class in UK is 28% as likely to get a PHD vs privileged origins. [@6]
    => UK working class are 3 times less likely to get a PhD
* 4% of UK uni staff declare disability, vs 16% of pop [@7]
    => UK uni staff are 4 times less likely to declare a disability
* LGBT+ community have an increased risk of developing mental illness (1.5x higher than the general population) [@12], (but slight overrepresentation of LGBT representation in [@13])


All those are more likely to suffer for instance from impostor syndrom [@14,@15,@16,@17] or bullying/harassment (43% of UK researchers, vs 49% for women, 62% for disabled) [@18] (37% of international researchers, vs 45% homosexual, 60% racialized) [@19]   (mostly by people in power positions, but also peers [@18])



## It's not your fault, part3 : the advisor

Once again, the list is highly inspired from "Managing your Mental Health during your PhD: A Survival Guide.  Dr Zoe Ayres.".

This is where we are missing the most "scientific" foundations. An issue is maybe that we, advisors, are not willing enough to participate in studies, or maybe studies are not willing enough to question advisors? Or 

Some advisors could improve:
* never received any training
* over/under controling
* workaholic
* no organization
* survivor bias 

Some advisors are toxic/cross the red-line:
* sink and swim adepts
* don´t care about your wellbeing
* suffering is a rite of passage
* mental/sexual harassment
    

# What to do

Most personal part, no particular references. Could be nice though.

Note: [2] is not a scientific study and may include some bias, but it still represents about 10% of the total population, and gives many valuable testimonies. The lack of scientific study in France is in fact a bad sign.
