Discriminations, Harassment and Unwell-being in Academia - Understand, React and Prevent

# Preliminaries


This page summarizes a ~45 minutes presentation that can be given at seminar. This page follows the overall structure of the presentation.

## Abstract

Many studies, internationaly or nationaly, demonstrate that the academic world suffers from discriminations, harrasment and unwell-being issues. It can be difficult to clearly acknowledge this and take actions against it, and it is of course even harder when we are in vulnerable positions and/or suffer from such issues directly. This talk will start by providing examples and studies to illustrate the current state of affairs and the scale of the issues, which first needs to be acknowledged to enable any kind of change. Then, we will present some of the root causes of all this, notably trying to distinguish symptoms and causes, in order to understand how to fight back as efficiently as possible. This will lead us to question the dominant culture in academia and many of its inherent mechanisisms that can lead to a toxic culture, notably discussing its highly competitive nature or the one-on-one supervision setting.  With those foundations and trying to follow an evidence-based approach, we will discuss how it is possible to act, for helping and protecting ourselves and  others, both on the long term and on the short term and at all levels of the institutions. We will thus focus on concrete possible actions that can help both witnesses and targets of dangerous situations happening right now to manage the emergency, but also on actions and policies that can help build an environnment and a culture where such situations do not happen anymore.




## Goals of the presentation

- aknowledge the scale of the issues
- understand some links between academic culture  (publish or perish,  crunch, hierarchy and adivsor power over career, star culture, ego and competition, think we are highly educated and thus unbiased), to link with (impossibility to take a maternal leave, normalization of unwell being, fear of retaliation, fear of looking dumb), and identify root causes
- make people aware of their privileges, and their blind spots. Understand how a majority culture forces unwell being on minorities.
- give some concrete paths to actions
 -- daily thing:
    --- spread a good culture
	--- don't be a bystander, learn and be ready to react to the inacceptable.
	--- think about answers to widespread myths "risk of false accusations", "it's just a joke", "we are now discriminiting white men", "We can't say anything anymore", "Quotas are unfair and breaks merit based hiring"
 -- long term: 
   --- form oneselves
   --- think about what you can do at your levels to go in the right decision (in selection comittees to shape better hiring practices, as a department head, ...)
- don't essentialize, beware of labels -> we are refering to sociological labels. 


<!> science shows that knowledge does not always lead to behavioural change for agressors. Be clear about what is acceptable and what is not. 
<!> for women in middle school saying that there is a lot of discrimination may make them less likely to try. 


# Introduction


Disclaimer: this talk may create unease, for two opposite reasons:

 - it may contain some examples evoking bad experiences for some people
 - some facts may be difficult for some people to accept, and create a strong sentiment of resistance and rejection,  as well as cognitive disonance.


 
Positive Intent: 
 - Alternative title= How do to good computer science research? 
 - We are researchers, so faced with a problem, we should try to tackle it together, make some hypothesis and attempts, be wrong, try again, be wrong and wrong until we are right a little bit more, and iterate until we make progress. And all I will be talking about are problems that make us do bad science. So, collectively, let's be researchers. Let's be problem solver. Let's find out how to do good science!


We are researcher?
 As most as possible, many things from this talk are sourced, and, I dare say it, for many points, very seriously so. (and if not, we can improve on it together!)
 
 Massive consensus report from the academical sciences, countless studies and metareviews,
 
 
 

# The state of things, a first glance

##	Statistics on parity in CS

### Evidence 1: lack of women CS

### Evidence 2: the leaky pipeline in science

![](biblio-pics/shefigure-stem.png)

### Hypothesis 1: bias and stereotypes?

Our brains are biased, no questions asked.

![](biblio-pics/illusion-Sailboat.gif)

There are biases very early on against women in science: from meta review of 100 studies, "by age 6, children already think that boys are better than girls at computer science and engineering"  [@miller2024development]

So, it is all explained because women believe they don't believe in CS, and hiring committees are also making biases decisions?


### Counter-evidence 1: the leaky pipeline is everywhere

### Counter-evidence 2: implicit-association training impact is unclear

 Let's explore more facts!

## Unwell being

## Is-it just "natural" ?





# The state of things, looking deeper	

## The magical hidding glasses, by Privileged Inc (TM)

Is there anything striking about this image?

![](biblio-pics/man_woman_holding_hands.jpg)

And this one?

![](biblio-pics/two_men_holding_hands.jpg)

For heteorsexual, holding hands is not a question, it is taken for granted. For an homosexual couple, it feels widely different, you see the looks of some people, questioning stare, judgind stare. And we can feel threatened. It is factually a risk.

-> If you are not the victim of a prejudice, we don't see it. We might not even see it is a privilege!

It is harder for an homosexual in a relationship to talk at work about what they did last weekend, whitout having to do a coming out.

# The roots of it all

## Violence is a continuum (most widespread vs most severe)

## Power relations and competition



# Act

## Don't be shitheads

Don't do it:  as a general rule, don't touch or be very close to people at the workplace! don't have one on one meetings with subordinates outside of the worplace! Don't ever say somebody does not belong here because of ..."

## Learn and improve

Some tools: violentometre (phd, vss), the hitchiker's guide

## Question the toxic culture, spread a better mentality

It's normal to not work outside of the office. It's normal if research is not my whole life. It's ok if I don't publish one more paper this year. It's ok if I go on long vacations. It's ok if I don't want to pursue research after my PhD. 

## Don't be complicit, be an ally!

### Answers to widespread myths:

 "risk of false accusations" - a 10 year study at a university evaluated that between 2 to 10% of accusations were false ones [@lisak2010false], 
 To be compared with the omipresence of agregations, maybe we should stop what has been proved to destroy people, rather than stop trying because of something that rarely happens, and is in fact detected (remember that in many cases, accusers have many forms of proofs, emails, text messages, witnesses, and that agressors often do many others)
 
 "it's just a joke" - recall that all the different levels of violence support one another, and that the lower level support and enable worse things. Violent people are using your "just a joke" to justify their behaviour. Who are you making you laugh?
 
 "we are now discriminiting white men" - No, we are trying to remove privileges. The French revolution was not "discriminating noble mens" damnit.
 
 "We can't say anything anymore" - It is actually the converse. People that were silenced for too  long can finally speak up and try to be heard. 
 
 "Quotas are unfair and breaks merit based hiring" - there is not merit currently. If I win a running race against somebody carrying a 50kg backpack, where is my merit exactly? 
 
 
## Everywhere, question if we can't do better

### PhD advisors

Follow mentoring trainings, that do take into account power imbalance. 

### PhD thesis committees

Men inviting women are putting pressure on women (see mails at the end of ), and that participates to the fact that whitin owmen, the repartition is horrible. 
Idea - always include in your invitation mails for women : "If you have more than 2 or 3 thesis committees already planned this year, please decline this invitation."

### Frequent climate surveys update

### Include "whithin" the usual scientific seminar talks on this

https://egalite-fh.irisa.fr/animation/seminaire-fifty-fifty/


### Hiring 


bare minimal: systematic bias training
New ideas:
 - agree before hands on criterion and use rubrics?
 - have a jury member be responsible for highlightings whenever a new criterion appears or disappear when evaluating a person
 - evaluate speech time repartition in jurys? (http://arementalkingtoomuch.com/) objective feedback that everybody can take home and reflect on.
 - for people who will be teaching, include a question on what they would do in front of a discriminating situation among students: 'A license male student does not want to do a group project with a women student, stating that women are bad at computer science, how do you answer them?'
 - 

And maybe, some crazy ideas
- explicit quotas, to restore some form of merit?
- abolish prizes?
- abolish one-to-one thesis supervising?
- And, maybe even, push for randomized based hiring? (make a pool of candidates passing requirments to be a good researcher, then random draw)



# final words

Bad things are here. And things might even be worthening soon.

![](biblio-pics/sif-com-fig4.png)

But, we are researchers. So, let's be researchers. Let's solve this problem! Scientific work whitin 

And if you feel disconfort on all this, be a researcher. Take this new data point, and question it. Is this disconfort what so many others feels all the time?
