Discriminations, Harassment and Unwell-being in Academia - Understand, React and Prevent

# Preliminaries


This page summarizes a ~45 minutes presentation that can be given at seminar. This page follows the overall structure of the presentation.

## Abstract

Many studies, internationaly or nationaly, demonstrate that the academic world suffers from discriminations, harrasment and unwell-being issues. It can be difficult to clearly acknowledge this and take actions against it, and it is of course even harder when we are in vulnerable positions and/or suffer from such issues directly. This talk will start by providing examples and studies to illustrate the current state of affairs and the scale of the issues, which first needs to be acknowledged to enable any kind of change. Then, we will present some of the root causes of all this, notably trying to distinguish symptoms and causes, in order to understand how to fight back as efficiently as possible. This will lead us to question the dominant culture in academia and many of its inherent mechanisisms that can lead to a toxic culture, notably discussing its highly competitive nature or the one-on-one supervision setting.  With those foundations and trying to follow an evidence-based approach, we will discuss how it is possible to act, for helping and protecting ourselves and  others, both on the long term and on the short term and at all levels of the institutions. We will thus focus on concrete possible actions that can help both witnesses and targets of dangerous situations happening right now to manage the emergency, but also on actions and policies that can help build an environnment and a culture where such situations do not happen anymore.




## Goals of the presentation

- aknowledge the scale of the issues
- understand some links between academic culture  (publish or perish,  crunch, hierarchy and adivsor power over career, star culture, ego and competition, think we are highly educated and thus unbiased), to link with (impossibility to take a maternal leave, normalization of unwell being, fear of retaliation, fear of looking dumb), and identify root causes
- make people aware of their privileges, and their blind spots. Understand how a majority culture forces unwell being on minorities.
- give some concrete paths to actions
 -- daily thing:
    --- spread a good culture
	--- don't be a bystander, learn and be ready to react to the inacceptable.
	--- think about answers to widespread myths "risk of false accusations", "it's just a joke", "we are now discriminiting white men", "We can't say anything anymore", "Quotas are unfair and breaks merit based hiring"
 -- long term: 
   --- form oneselves
   --- think about what you can do at your levels to go in the right decision (in selection comittees to shape better hiring practices, as a department head, ...)
- don't essentialize, beware of labels -> we are refering to sociological labels. 


<!> science shows that knowledge does not always lead to behavioural change for agressors. Be clear about what is acceptable and what is not. 
<!> for women in middle school saying that there is a lot of discrimination may make them less likely to try. 


# Introduction


Disclaimer: this talk may create unease, for two opposite reasons:

 - it may contain some examples evoking bad experiences for some people
 - some facts may be difficult for some people to accept, and create a strong sentiment of resistance and rejection,  as well as cognitive disonance.


 
Positive Intent: 
 - Alternative title= How do to good computer science research? 
 - We are researchers, so faced with a problem, we should try to tackle it together, make some hypothesis and attempts, be wrong, try again, be wrong and wrong until we are right a little bit more, and iterate until we make progress. And all I will be talking about are problems that make us do bad science. So, collectively, let's be researchers. Let's be problem solver. Let's find out how to do good science!


We are researcher?
 As most as possible, many things from this talk are sourced, and, I dare say it, for many points, very seriously so. (and if not, we can improve on it together!)

## Violence is a continuum (most widespread vs most severe)

## Power relations and competition


# Act

## Don't be shitheads

Don't do it:  as a general rule, don't touch or be very close to people at the workplace! don't have one on one meetings with subordinates outside of the worplace! Don't ever say somebody does not belong here because of ..."

## Learn and improve

Some tools: violentometre (phd, vss), the hitchiker's guide

## Question the toxic culture, spread a better mentality

## Don't be complicit, be an ally!

### Answers to widespread myths:

 "risk of false accusations", "it's just a joke", "we are now discriminiting white men", "We can't say anything anymore", "Quotas are unfair and breaks merit based hiring"
 
 
## Everywhere, question if we can't do better

### PhD thesis committees

### hiring
