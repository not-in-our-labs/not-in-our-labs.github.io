Discriminations, Harassment and Unwell-being in Academia - Understand, React and Prevent

# Preliminaries


This page summarizes a ~45 minutes presentation that can be given at seminar. This page follows the overall structure of the presentation.

## Abstract

Many studies, internationaly or nationaly, demonstrate that the academic world suffers from discriminations, harrasment and unwell-being issues. It can be difficult to clearly acknowledge this and take actions against it, and it is of course even harder when we are in vulnerable positions and/or suffer from such issues directly. This talk will start by providing examples and studies to illustrate the current state of affairs and the scale of the issues, which first needs to be acknowledged to enable any kind of change. Then, we will present some of the root causes of all this, notably trying to distinguish symptoms and causes, in order to understand how to fight back as efficiently as possible. This will lead us to question the dominant culture in academia and many of its inherent mechanisisms that can lead to a toxic culture, notably discussing its highly competitive nature or the one-on-one supervision setting.  With those foundations and trying to follow an evidence-based approach, we will discuss how it is possible to act, for helping and protecting ourselves and  others, both on the long term and on the short term and at all levels of the institutions. We will thus focus on concrete possible actions that can help both witnesses and targets of dangerous situations happening right now to manage the emergency, but also on actions and policies that can help build an environnment and a culture where such situations do not happen anymore.




## Goals of the presentation

- aknowledge the scale of the issues
- understand some links between academic culture  (publish or perish,  crunch, hierarchy and adivsor power over career, star culture, ego and competition, think we are highly educated and thus unbiased), to link with (impossibility to take a maternal leave, normalization of unwell being, fear of retaliation, fear of looking dumb), and identify root causes
- make people aware of their privileges, and their blind spots. Understand how a majority culture forces unwell being on minorities.
- give some concrete paths to actions
 -- daily thing:
    --- spread a good culture
	--- don't be a bystander, learn and be ready to react to the inacceptable.
	--- think about answers to widespread myths "risk of false accusations", "it's just a joke", "we are now discriminiting white men", "We can't say anything anymore", "Quotas are unfair and breaks merit based hiring"
 -- long term: 
   --- form oneselves
   --- think about what you can do at your levels to go in the right decision (in selection comittees to shape better hiring practices, as a department head, ...)
- don't essentialize, beware of labels -> we are refering to sociological labels. 


<!> science shows that knowledge does not always lead to behavioural change for agressors. Be clear about what is acceptable and what is not. 
<!> for women in middle school saying that there is a lot of discrimination may make them less likely to try. 


# Introduction


Disclaimer: this talk may create unease, for two opposite reasons:

 - it may contain some examples evoking bad experiences for some people
 - some facts may be difficult for some people to accept, and create a strong sentiment of resistance and rejection,  as well as cognitive disonance.


 
Positive Intent: 
 - Alternative title= How do to good computer science research? 
 - We are researchers, so faced with a problem, we should try to tackle it together, make some hypothesis and attempts, be wrong, try again, be wrong and wrong until we are right a little bit more, and iterate until we make progress. And all I will be talking about are problems that make us do bad science. So, collectively, let's be researchers. Let's be problem solver. Let's find out how to do good science!


We are researcher?
 As most as possible, many things from this talk are sourced, and, I dare say it, for many points, very seriously so. (and if not, we can improve on it together!)



 Massive consensus report from the academical sciences, countless studies and metareviews,
 


We are researcher? 
  Let's go together on an investigation!
 

# The state of things, a first glance

##	Statistics on parity in CS

### Evidence 1: lack of women CS

![](pics/plot-positions.png)


### Evidence 2: the leaky pipeline in science

![](biblio-pics/shefigure-stem.png)

### Hypothesis 1: bias and stereotypes?

Our brains are biased, no questions asked.

![](biblio-pics/illusion-Sailboat.gif)

There are biases very early on against women in science: from meta review of 100 studies, "by age 6, children already think that boys are better than girls at computer science and engineering"  [@miller2024development]


Campagne de recrutement de l’Éducation Nationale (2011):

![](biblio-pics/rw-bias-women-science-educ-nat-2023.jpeg)

![](biblio-pics/rw-slime-w.jpg)

![](biblio-pics/rw-slime-m.jpg)


So, it is all explained because women believe they don't believe in CS? 

### Counter-evidence: the leaky pipeline is everywhere

![](biblio-pics/shefigure-all.png)

![](biblio-pics/cnu-mcf-pu-p4.png)


 Let's explore more facts!

## Unwell being

### Evidence 3: depression

16 studies wordwilde, 24% of depression amoung phd students  [@satinsky2021systematic]

![](biblio-pics/satinsky2021systematic-fig2.png)


(TBC with 5/7% general population, and 13/15% for young adults)


### Evidence 4: overwork

6000 phd student survey by nature. [@woolston2019phds]
![](biblio-pics/woolston2019phds.png)


### Evidence 4: everybody is overwhelmed

Wordwide survey [@19]

![](biblio-pics/cactus-feeling.png)

### Hypothesis: it is natural, research is by essence hard

First time failing
No tick boxes
Impostor syndrom
Overwork

This is shared by a lot of people.

### Counter-evidence: who the hell are we kidding?

Let's go work from midnight to 8am in a factory, and we'll see what is by essence a hard job.


So: can I find some other things that explain the bad experiences, and the gender-gap? Beyond the "research is naturally hard" and "there is just some stereotypes playing against women in CS"? 


# The state of things, looking deeper 

The issue is way bigger than it may seem for a lot of people.


##	Statistics on discriminations

 - **men** are **2.6 times** more likely to become a professor
 - **somebody without a declared disability** is **4.6 times** more likely to become a uni staff
 - a **white person** is **6.2 times** more likely to become a UK professor than a **black person**
 - somebody with **a close relative with a PhD** is **at least 2.4 times** more likely to get a PhD
 

And more! there are also weight related discrimination, religion related discrimnation, or LGBTQIA+ discrimination.




### The discrimination stems from many active behaviours

Many gender based examples:

 - Men spend more time doing research, and leaves the less rewarding work to women.  [@winslow2010gender] [@o2017asked]
 - Men self-cite 70 percent more than women [@king2017men]
 - Female authored papers are less cited  [@bendels2018gender], and notably less likely to be cited by men

 
Evaluation is biased: 
 - A women name on a CV implies evaluation bias [@steinpreis1999impact]
 - The "two-body" problem is only used to refuse women not seen as movable [@rivera2017two]
 - Women don't get credit for group collaborations, while men do.  [@sarsons2017recognition]
 - The more women on a hiring committee, the harsher men are toward women candidates.


Also for other groups:
 - URM faculty received 7% more negative votes and were 44% less likely to receive unanimous votes from P&T committees  [@masters2024underrepresented]
 

All this is evidence based: fun fact, you are more likely to refuse those facts if you are a man! [@handley2015quality]


### Men are gate-keeping



French 2015 reform negative impact on STEM fields  [@deschamps2024gender]
![](biblio-pics/deschamps2024gender-fig3.png)

**the negative effect of the reform is concentrated in committees headed by men, this result seems driven by the reaction of men to the reform**


-> So, the people with privileges have many behaviours that enforce those privilege, up to gate-keeping. 


But, worse than judging badly everybody. We forcibly push them out, make them feel unwelcome through many things. And it can be from many things we don't see or think about.
 
 
 
## The magical hidding glasses, by Privileged Inc (TM)

Is there anything striking about this image?

![](biblio-pics/man_woman_holding_hands.jpg)

And this one?

![](biblio-pics/two_men_holding_hands.jpg)

For heteorsexual, holding hands is not a question, it is taken for granted. For an homosexual couple, it feels widely different, you see the looks of some people, questioning stare, judgind stare. And we can feel threatened. It is factually a risk.

-> If you are not the victim of a prejudice, we don't see it. We might not even see it is a privilege!

It is harder for an homosexual in a relationship to talk at work about what they did last weekend, whitout having to do a coming out.

If a LGBT person don't feel that they can do their coming out at the lab, their life is concretely more difficult there.

The omnipresent "invisible" phenomenom.

## Statistics on harassment


### It is everywhere

The evidence is overwhelming:


Wordwide survey:
![](biblio-pics/acascience-fig11.png)

A massive consensus study report from the US national academies of sciences, engineering and medecine.
![](biblio-pics/benya2018sexual-fig-3.1.png)

![](biblio-pics/benya2018sexual-fig-3.2.jpg)

![](biblio-pics/lipinsky2022gender-fig1.png)

### It targets many groups differently

![](biblio-pics/lipinsky2022gender-table1.png)

 - "Depuis leur arrivée dans l’enseignement supérieur, **24 % des femmes, 9 % des hommes et 33 % des 
transgenre/non binaire/queer** ont subi au moins une forme d’**agression sexuelle ou de viol (ou tentative)**, souvent réitérée."  [@vss-alcool-mildeca]


![](biblio-pics/moran2020.png)

### Of course it has consequences, people are quitting, subperforming

![](biblio-pics/lipinsky2022gender-fig3.png)

# The roots of it all

## Violence is a continuum (most widespread vs most severe)

![](biblio-pics/benya2018sexual-iceberg-sexual-harassment.jpg)



"sexual coercion never took place without unwanted sexual attention and gender harass-
ment."  [@benya2018sexual]

## Power relations and competition

power imbalances foster and sustain sexual-harassment [@benya2018sexual]  [@zara2024looking]  [@bergeron2025can], and in fact other form of  harassments  and discriminations [@dhume2024quelles]

"the **academic** workplace has the **second highest rate of sexual harassment at 58 percent**
(the military has the high-est rate at 69 percent) when comparing it
with military, private sector, and the government" [@benya2018sexual]

### The other consequences of


## Tying it all together

Toxic culture: competition, masculinism, power imbalance, star culture

```
Strong power and domination relations
  =sustained by=> discrimnination: people in power actively discriminating to keep their power, increasing and repeating the effect of discriminations from society
                            |
                         worsened by
						    |
                            v
  =empowers=> a space rife with harassment, from too common gender-harassment to sexual assault  
     -> harassment being one of the bullying technique used by people to rise in the competition, and kick out people	 
  =causes=> competition, everybody depressed, overworked and overstressed by the competition
  =sustained by=> many lies: merit, medals, star culture
```
  
## Is all this an issue?

Ok, first of, morally, of course. Right?

But, if it is really needed, some additional arguments.

### Philosophy

It is broadly recognized that science is unethical when it involves misstreating human beings in experiments. 

But, wait. Should'nt this be " science is unethical when it involves misstreating human beings". Aren't colleagues, no matter there position (permanent, PhD), their beliefs, their gender, their whatever, **human beings**.

In our labs where harassment is riffed, science is unethical, and there is a dire need for change

### A lack of diversity leads to biased and dangerous science

 - airbags systems have been designed historcally for men body shapes, leading to less chances for women to survive car crashes
 - medicine is dosed for men, with few womens in cohorts (19% for antiviral, 38% for vaccins, 11% for aids)
 - women have distinct symptoms sometimes - yentl syndrom for cardiovascular diceases  (women with such conditions have 10% more chances of dying when arriving at the hospital)
 - LLM with racist or sexist bias, now deployed in companies to filter CVs.
 
 
### Diversity breads inovation! 

 **publications by mixed-gender teams are more cited**  [@campbell2013gender]
 **science by mixed-gender teams is better** (though underrepresetend, significantly more novel and impactfull) [@yang2022gender]
"**diversity** in inputs by author ethnicity, location, and references
**leads to greater contributions to science** as measured by impact factors and citations."  [@freeman2015collaborating]
**Diverse scholars are more innovative, but their work is taken up by others less than it should be**  [@hofstra2020diversity]


# Act



Three different point of view:
  * individual: when we wonder what women lacks -> mentoring, networking
  * societal: when it is not related to academia: help child care, part time dispositives
  * organisational: institutions are producing inequalities, they must take action, to fight gender harassment, inclusivity. fight against stereotypes, quotas


Institutions do not do enough: do not adress the most common form of harassment (gender-harassment), provide report procedure opaque  [@he2024association] and inefficient, leading to a feeling of betrayal [@bergeron2025can], and often focused on protecting the image of the institution  [@faniko2021inegalites]. Universities focus on following the law meant to reduce discrimination, which add little impact on harassment. [@benya2018sexual] Most targets of harassment don't report issues. [@lipinsky2022gender]

Actually, scratch that, a fourth point of view:
 * ours. We do the research, we are part of this toxic culture, and we have power over it. We can be the change. (meme needed for the cheesy part)
 
A global change is needed: 
 
"A **systemwide change to the culture and climate** in higher education is
required to prevent and effectively address all three forms of sexual ha-
rassment." 

We need to focus on **broad cultural change**  [@johnson2015potential]

## Don't be shitheads

Don't do it:  as a general rule, don't touch or be very close to people at the workplace! don't have one on one meetings with subordinates outside of the worplace! Don't ever say somebody does not belong here because of ..."


## Question the toxic culture, spread a better mentality


"the most potent predictor of sexual harassment is organizational
climate—the degree to which those in the organization perceive that
sexual harassment is or is not tolerated." [@benya2018sexual]



Relieve the pressure. It's normal to not work outside of the office. It's normal if research is not my whole life. It's ok if I don't publish one more paper this year. It's ok if I go on long vacations. It's ok if I don't want to pursue research after my PhD. 

Do not do a permanent crunch.



## Learn and improve

Some tools: violentometre (phd, vss), the hitchiker's guide


## Don't be complicit, be an ally!

### Face the truth 

**Facts are too often ignored**: "The interview responses demonstrate
that the behavior of male colleagues, whom higher-ranking faculty or
administrators perceived as “superstars” in their particular
substantive area, was often minimized or ignored." [@benya2018sexual]

Don't be a passive bystander.

1) 



Ideally: Do not let any "joke" pass. Confront bullies and harrassers. Supports their targets.  Be outspoken, often, about what is normal and what is anormal. 
BUT: don't forget to protect yourself -> the people with a permanent position can more easily react and confront with less risks.

### Answers to widespread myths:

 "risk of false accusations" - a 10 year study at a university evaluated that between 2 to 10% of accusations were false ones [@lisak2010false], 
 To be compared with the omipresence of agregations, maybe we should stop what has been proved to destroy people, rather than stop trying because of something that rarely happens, and is in fact detected (remember that in many cases, accusers have many forms of proofs, emails, text messages, witnesses, and that agressors often do many others)
 
 "it's just a joke" - recall that all the different levels of violence support one another, and that the lower level support and enable worse things. Violent people are using your "just a joke" to justify their behaviour. Who are you making you laugh?
 
 "we are now discriminiting white men" - No, we are trying to remove privileges. The French revolution was not "discriminating noble mens" damnit.
 
 "We can't say anything anymore" - It is actually the converse. People that were silenced for too  long can finally speak up and try to be heard. 
 
 "Quotas are unfair and breaks merit based hiring" - there is not merit currently. If I win a running race against somebody carrying a 50kg backpack, where is my merit exactly? 
 
 
## Everywhere, question if we can't do better

### PhD advisors

Follow mentoring trainings, that do take into account power imbalance. 

### PhD thesis committees

Men inviting women are putting pressure on women (see mails at the end of ), and that participates to the fact that whitin owmen, the repartition is horrible. 
Idea - always include in your invitation mails for women : "If you have more than 2 or 3 thesis committees already planned this year, please decline this invitation."

### Frequent climate surveys update

### Include "whithin" the usual scientific seminar talks on this

https://egalite-fh.irisa.fr/animation/seminaire-fifty-fifty/


### Hiring 


bias training? implicit-association training impact is unclear

Study at Berkley:
![](biblio-pics/culpepper2023rubrics-fig20a.png)




New ideas:
 - agree before hands on criterion and use rubrics?
 - have a jury member be responsible for highlightings whenever a new criterion appears or disappear when evaluating a person
 - evaluate speech time repartition in jurys? (http://arementalkingtoomuch.com/) objective feedback that everybody can take home and reflect on.
 - for people who will be teaching, include a question on what they would do in front of a discriminating situation among students: 'A license male student does not want to do a group project with a women student, stating that women are bad at computer science, how do you answer them?'
 - 

And maybe, some crazy ideas
- explicit quotas, to restore some form of merit?
- abolish prizes?
- abolish one-to-one thesis supervising?
- And, maybe even, push for randomized based hiring? (make a pool of candidates passing requirments to be a good researcher, then random draw)



# final words

Bad things are here. And things might even be worthening soon.

![](biblio-pics/sif-com-fig4.png)

But, we are researchers. So, let's be researchers. Let's solve this problem! Scientific work whitin 

And if you feel disconfort on all this, be a researcher. Take this new data point, and question it. Is this disconfort what so many others feels all the time?
