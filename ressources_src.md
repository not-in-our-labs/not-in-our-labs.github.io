# Gender and sexual harassment

### Violences sexuelles dans l’enseignement supérieur en France : un focus sur l’alcool et le cannabis [@vss-alcool-mildeca]

Rapport sur une enquête nationale menéee en 2023-2024, 67 000 répondants:

 - "Depuis leur arrivée dans l’enseignement supérieur, **24 % des femmes, 9 % des hommes et 33 % des 
transgenre/non binaire/queer** ont subi au moins une forme d’**agression sexuelle ou de viol (ou tentative)**, souvent réitérée."5
 - "Selon les types de violences concernés (tentative d’agression sexuelle, agression sexuelle, tentative de viol ou viol), les étudiantes sont de 2.7 à 4.5 fois plus fréquemment victimes que les étudiants."
 - "23.8 % des étudiantes déclarent avoir subi une tentative d‘agression sexuelle, 18.7 % une agression sexuelle, 3.8 % une tentative de viol et 5 % un viol" (vs 1,1% de viol pour les hommes)
 - "Plus de la moitié des violences sexistes et sexuelles (VSS) en milieu étudiant implique une
consommation d'alcool."
- "Dans 90 à 95% des cas, quelles que soient les violences subies, les auteurs désignés sont de sexe masculin"
- En informatique, on est à 30% de taux de victimation pour les étudiantes.

### The Potential of Sexual Consent Interventions on College Campuses: A Literature Review on the Barriers to Establishing Affirmative Sexual Consent [@johnson2015potential]
https://files.core.ac.uk/download/pdf/228819905.pdf

There are rape myths: "In the case of sexual consent, **three rape myths**
are relevant to the new affirmative consent law: (a) **unintentional
sexual behavior occurs**, (b) **miscommunication about sexual behavior
happens**, and (c) **rape does not occur in a preexisting sexual
relationship**." 

They are myths:

 - "Ultimately, reported accidental or unintentional intercourse
results from coercive behavior and a lack of sexual consent. The
findings of this research undermine the rape myth suggesting that the
perpetrator did not mean to commit rape."
 - "This body of research about sexual communication demonstrates that
miscommunication cannot be blamed for sexual assault occurring "
 - " majority of women are sexually assaulted by an acquaintance"


Sexual scripts are created by medias and culture:

 - "A sexual script represents the
cognitive schema of the normative progression of events
in a sexual encounter"
 - "readers of men’s magazines reported lower intentions to ask for sexual consent, as
well as lower intentions to respect their partners’ sexual
consent decisions"

We need to focus on **broad cultural change**:
"Sexual communication, as discussed in this article, is shaped by
sociocultural issues such as sexual scripts, gender roles, and rape
myths (Murnen et al., 2002). Interventions that support broader
cultural change are needed (Jozkowski & Humphreys, 2014; Murnen et
al., 2002). If affirmative consent were to become the new social norm,
students may change to express more favorable attitudes towards
affirmative consent, change their sexual communication to actively
engage in affirmative consent, and reduce the prevalence of sexual
assault."

*Keywords*: sexual scripts, culture, rape myths

### Impact of the undressing consent program [@scott2024impact]

A US university, reports on training on consent, with a 90 minute dedicated training, with which students are very satisfied and yields change:

 - "Since 2021, Huron and King’s have invested in enhanced efforts to
prevent sexual violence on campus through the delivery of a 90-minute,
live-facilitated, interactive prevention program titled "Undressing
Consent.""
 -  "Almost **90% of the students were satisfied with Undressing Consent**.
They found it to be important and valuable."
 - "Most female and non-binary students reported high level of comfort in
having conversations about desires and boundaries despite
retrospectively reporting that Undressing Consent helped them better
communicate their boundaries. "
 - "The program was found to help navigate the transition to university
and led to some changes in student knowledge and attitudes about
consent. "

*Keywords*: consent, student training

### Effects of Mandatory Sexual Misconduct Training on University Campuses [@htun2022effects]

"Our surprising finding is that **training makes women less likely to
say that they would report sexual assault**. In all three studies,
participating in training is associated with a large and highly
statistically significant drop in the share of women who affirm that,
if they were sexually assaulted by another student, they would be
“very likely” or “somewhat likely” to report the experience to the
university.  Although our study was not designed to systematically
explore the reasons for the drop in reporting intentions, we speculate
about it on the basis of interview material and responses to other
survey questions. We suggest that training may aggravate women’s
perceptions of the social risks involved in reporting. Women students
resist labeling their experiences as assault and categorizing their
sexual relationships as nonconsensual or coercive in the ways
portrayed by training"

" The training produces some small positive effects: students gain
broader definitions of sexual misconduct and are less likely to
endorse common rape myths, and women students express less sexist
attitudes immediately after training."

*Keywords*: sexual assault, negative effect of training, fear of consequecnes

### Looking for a preventive approach to sexual harassment in academia. A systematic review [@zara2024looking]

"The findings confirm that academia is a breeding ground for SH
due to **power imbalances** and that vulnerabilities related to the macro-dynamics of power,
social and cultural inequalities are risk factors for SH. It is recommended that SH prevention
interventions in academia 1. adopt a **socio-ecological perspective**; 2. include evidence-based
programs such as those **dedicated to bystanders**; 3. are integrated with each other through
valuable networking and multistakeholder involvement and 4. pay attention to support com-
plaints, victim listening and intake activitie"


On bystander programs:
"Like several previously presented training and projects, bystander programs can be
transversal and situated between the individual, interpersonal, and contextual levels (Ban-
yard, 2011); these programs focus on recognizing early signs of sexually harmful behav-
ior and developing skills to intervene. Within this framework, bystander programs play an
important role in raising community awareness and creating “guardians” who can prevent
certain forms of SH and/or offer support to victims. The research conducted confirms that
after participating in bystander intervention training, faculty staff also felt that they could
play a crucial role in preventing violence by modeling prosocial behavior, seeking to be
perceived as allies by students, and challenging cultural norms related to SV (Robinson
et al., 2020)"

Interventions must adopt a socio-ecological perspective:
"On a more conceptual level, some research emphasizes the need to always con-
sider gender-based violence as a problem related to social inequalities and to highlight
the close connection between multiple structural forms of oppression when designing
interventions (Atkinson & Standing, 2019; Banner et al., 2022; Hurtado, 2021). "

*Keywords*: sexual harassment, bystander training, power

### Association Between Sexual Harassment Intervention Strategies and the Sexual Harassment Perception and Attitude of University Students in Beijing, China [@he2024association]

A bad perception of universities willingwness to act may undermines training effect:
"Education, training, and publicity programs are key to addressing the issue
of sexual harassment on campuses (Cleary et al.,1994; de Lijster et al., 2016;
Erinosho et al., 2021). Positive associations between informal education activ-
ities, multiformat publicity, and female students’ intolerant attitudes toward
sexual harassment were also observed in this study. However, prevention
mechanisms were negatively associated with intolerant attitudes toward sex-
ual harassment. Informal education activities and multiformat publicity appear
to be positive strategies. There may be some problems with the design, opera-
tion, or other aspects of sexual harassment prevention mechanisms that con-
tribute to the negative impact on students’ attitudes toward sexual harassment.
This would appear to be partly explicable in terms of futility in university
prevention mechanisms. To protect their reputations, **some universities remain
silent, refuse to inform the public about the process and outcomes, and punish
harassers too lightly** (Lay, 2019; Lichty et al., 2008; Robertson et al., 1988)."

*Keywords*: opaque report processes, training


# Discriminations

## Gender discrimination in academia

### The gender citation gap: Approaches, explanations, and implications [@wu2024gender]

**Women publish less, but are cited as much per paper**:
" I show that articles written
by women receive comparable or even higher rates of cita-
tions than articles written by men. However, women tend
to accumulate fewer citations over time and at the career
level. Contrary to the notion that women are cited less per
article due to gender-based bias in research evaluation or
citing behaviors, this study suggests that the primary reason
for the lower citation rates at the author level is women
publishing fewer articles over their careers."


## Underrepresented minority (URM) discrimination


### Underrepresented minority faculty in the USA face a double standard in promotion and tenure decisions [@masters2024underrepresented]

"Data from five US universities on 1,571 faculty members’ P&T decisions show that **URM faculty received 7% more negative votes and were 44% less likely to receive unanimous votes from P&T committees**. A double standard in how scholarly productivity is rewarded is also observed, with below-average h-indexes being **judged more harshly for URM faculty than for non-URM faculty**."


# Looking forward


## Value of diversity

### Diversity leads to better science?  Gender-Heterogeneous Working Groups Produce Higher Quality Science [@campbell2013gender]

At a ecology and environmental sciences institute, **publications by mixed-gender teams are more cited**:
"While women continue to be underrepresented as working group participants, peer-reviewed publications with gender-heterogeneous authorship teams received 34% more citations than publications produced by gender-uniform authorship teams" 

*Keywords*: diversity, publication citations, better science

### Gender-diverse teams produce more novel and higher-impact [@yang2022gender]


In medical sciences, **science by mixed-gender teams is better** (though underrepresetend, significantly more novel and impactfull):

"We study mixed-gender research teams, examining 6.6 million papers
published across the medical sciences since 2000 and establishing
several core findings. First, the fraction of publications by
mixed-gender teams has grown rapidly, yet mixed-gender teams continue
to be underrepresented compared to the expectations of a null
model. Second, despite their underrepresentation, **the publications
of mixed- gender teams are substantially more novel and impactful than
t/he publications of same- gender teams of equivalent size**."


## Improve Hiring

### Minimizing the Influence of Gender Bias on the Faculty Search Process [@fine2014minimizing]

**Workshops on diversity/bias training are somewhat efficient** (study at University of Wisconsin-Madison):
 "In departments where women are underrepresented, workshop participation is associated with a significant increase in the odds of making a job offer to a woman candidate, and with a non-significant increase in the odds of hiring a woman."



### Searching for a Diverse Faculty: What Really Works. [@goulden2019searching]

Use data from UC Berkley hirings to study efficiency of approachs
w.r.t. diversity hiring: "the 220 searches for which we received
survey data represented 94 per- cent of the 29,832 applicants for
Berkeley positions from academic years 2012–13 through 2015–1"

Most **promising approaches**:

- **shaping job description** "Of all the practices we studied, linking
job descriptions to issues of gender, race, or ethnicity had the most
impressive positive association with greater diversity.", "It is not
always easy for departments to think outside of traditional
disciplinary structures, but our data strongly suggest that this is an
effort well worth making when departments want to be sure they are
attracting the broadest pools of strong applicants."
- **setting departemental priorities** " some departments also explicitly
prioritized hiring faculty who will be able to make strong
contributions to the departmental goals for advancing diversity,
equity, and inclusion. "
- **mixed committees composition** (but put in place teaching hour
diminution for women!), "Compared with search committees that did not
have at least 40 percent women, those that did were more likely to
have higher percentages of both women and URMs under consideration at
each search stage"
- **targetted outreach** "Our research also confirmed the promise of
several kinds of targeted outreach that encourage applications from a
small number of unusually strong candidates who also would advance the
department’s diversity and equity goals"

Some approaches without support: "Our data **did not provide support for** using three search practices
that often are recommended or mandated: **reviewing comparative data,
taking steps to counter implicit bias, and requiring applicants to
provide evidence of their commitment to diversity**."

## Can I Say “No”? How Power Dynamics Hinder Consent in University Settings
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/10778012251338485

" Restricting the notion of sexual consent to its communicative
dimension risks perpetuating rape myths and victim-blaming, placing undue blame on
victims who have “failed to properly communicate.” Additionally, the influence of
unequal power dynamics and gendered and social norms need to be addressed when dis-
cussing consent and sexual violence. Consent education, including affirmative consent
and grey area trainings, remains important (Setty, 2023) and should incorporate chal-
lenges to social norms (e.g., heteronormative standards, gender-based power imbalances
such as expectations of male assertiveness and female compliance) and support the iden-
tification of conditions that render consent invalid (e.g., intoxication, coercion, position
of authority). The normalization of misconduct in supposedly safe environments and the
issue of institutional betrayal highlight the need for institutional change and courage.
Universities must promote cultural change, challenge social norms, and ensure transpar-
ency and accountability to rebuild trust"


## Weight bias in graduate school admissions
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.20171
Higher BMI significantly predicted fewer post-interview offers of admission into psychology graduate programs. Results also suggest this relationship is stronger for female applicants. BMI was not related to overall quality or the number of stereotypically weight-related adjectives in letters of recommendation. Surprisingly, higher BMI was related to more positive adjectives in letters.



## Weight bias among students and employees in university settings: an exploratory study
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11841011/
"Approximately half of the respondents reported experiencing weight-related stigma (44.7%), and half indicated holding prejudice towards overweight people (51.1%), with a moderate rate of bias according to the FPS (3.25). "

The research found that, of the 364 staff who opted to respond to questions on their experiences of sexual violence and harassment, 43% have experienced some form of this behaviour in their work or personal lives in the last year and 66% in the last five years. In the context of this research, SVH is a collective term that includes physical contact or non-physical conduct of a sexual nature that occurs in the absence of clear, knowing and voluntary consent.

## Increasing diversity in STEM academia: a scoping review of intervention evaluations

https://astro3d.org.au/we-achieved-gender-parity-in-astronomy-in-just-five-years/

" First, over 80% of the articles in this review were based in the US. While this does not mean
that interventions are not conducted elsewhere, it does suggest that the current evidence base is
predominantly shaped by a particular national context. "

"despite this caveat, the low numbers of
evaluated interventions targeting areas of diversity beyond gender and racial/ethnic minorities is
concerning as it may signal low priorit"

"Moreover, our findings point to the popularity of
support-based and diversity training interventions with a disproportionate focus on early career
in comparison to, for example, policy changes or interventions that address retention or equity
beyond the initial phases of the ‘pipeline’. As will be discussed further below, this pattern appears
to speak to an ‘individual responsibility’ approach that prioritises changing the individual over chan-
ging the system that disadvantages them"


"Third, the interventions we looked at overwhelmingly reflected ‘master’s tools’, that is they were
implemented or endorsed by the institutional contexts that perpetuate the inequalities that are
addressed (Morimoto and Zajicek 2014). This is perhaps unsurprising as we were focussing on
(largely) top-down intervention rather than grassroots action, but it does raise the question of the
extent to which sustainable change is possible. "

## Women are underrepresented in fields where success is believed to require brilliance

Field-specific ability belief picture, "brillance"-focused field lead to less women in them. (figure 2)


"If the practitioners of fields with gender gaps made a concerted effort to highlight the role of sustained, long-term effort in achievement, the gender gaps in these fields may correspondingly be diminished."

## An Emphasis on Brilliance Fosters Masculinity-Contest Cultures
Andrea C. Vial https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9367-2081 andrea.vial@nyu.edu, Melis Muradoglu https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5162-8741, […], and Andrei Cimpian https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3553-6097

Women are underrepresented in fields in which success is believed to require brilliance, but the reasons for this pattern are poorly understood. We investigated perceptions of a “masculinity-contest culture,” an organizational environment of ruthless competition, as a key mechanism whereby a perceived emphasis on brilliance discourages female participation. Across three preregistered correlational and experimental studies involving adult lay participants online (N = 870) and academics from more than 30 disciplines (N = 1,347), we found a positive association between the perception that a field or an organization values brilliance and the perception that this field or organization is characterized by a masculinity-contest culture. This association was particularly strong among women. In turn, perceiving a masculinity-contest culture predicted lower interest and sense of belonging as well as stronger impostor feelings. Experimentally reducing the perception of a masculinity-contest culture eliminated gender gaps in interest and belonging in a brilliance-oriented organization, suggesting possible avenues for intervention.





## When Two Bodies Are (Not) a Problem: Gender and Relationship Status Discrimination in Academic Hiring
Lauren A. Rivera

"Drawing from gendered scripts of career and family that present men’s
careers as taking precedence over women’s, committee members assumed that heterosexual
women whose partners held academic or high-status jobs were not “movable,” and excluded
such women from offers when there were viable male or single female alternatives.
Conversely, committees infrequently discussed male applicants’ relationship status and
saw all female partners as movable. Consequently, I show that the “two-body problem” is a
gendered phenomenon embedded in cultural stereotypes and organizational practices that
can disadvantage women in academic hiring."


## Does the Gender Composition of Scientific Committees Matter?
    Manuel Bagues
    Mauro Sylos-Labini
    Natalia Zinovyeva
	
"We analyze how a larger presence of female evaluators affects committee decision-making using information on 100,000 applications to associate and full professorships in Italy and Spain. These applications were assessed by 8,000 randomly selected evaluators. A larger number of women in evaluation committees does not increase either the quantity or the quality of female candidates who qualify. Information from individual voting reports suggests that female evaluators are not significantly more favorable toward female candidates. At the same time, male evaluators become less favorable toward female candidates as soon as a female evaluator joins the committee. "


## Gender Quotas in Hiring Committees: A Boon or a Bane for Women?

law of 2015,  40% gender quotas.  

"Contrary to the objectives of the law, I show that the reform backfired and significantly lowered women’s probability of being hired. Because the negative effect of the reform is concentrated in committees headed by men, this result seems driven by the reaction of men to the reform.  I find little evidence that the reform affects supply-side characteristics, such as the likelihood of women applying. The results suggest that the underrepresentation of women is unlikely to be solved by simply increasing the share of women in hiring committees or interview panels."


## The Development of Children’s Gender Stereotypes About STEM and Verbal Abilities: A Preregistered Meta-Analytic Review of 98 Studies
David I. Miller email the author, Jillian E. Lauer, Courtney Tanenbaum, Lauren Burr

"This quantitative review of nearly 100 studies shows that, by age 6, children already think that boys are better than girls at computer science and engineering. With age, girls increasingly believe in male superiority in these technical fields—a stereotype that could potentially limit girls’ future aspirations. In contrast, children hold far more gender-neutral beliefs about math ability. Children also think that girls are much better in verbal domains like reading and writing, which could contribute to boys’ underachievement in those domains."


"Several recent studies have found “brilliance” stereotypes about exceptional intelligence favoring male targets among both child and adult participants in multiple cultures (Bian et al., 2017; Jaxon et al., 2019; Okanda et al., 2022; Shu et al., 2022; Storage et al., 2020; S. Zhao et al., 2022). "

(Bian et al,m2017 also shows that this impact the activites choosed)

"Young children are eager to find, remember, and construct positive information about their gender, driven by in-group gender bias as early as ages 3–5 (Dunham et al., 2016; Halim et al., 2017; Kurtz-Costes, Defreitas, et al., 2011). "

## Gendered Citations at Top Economic Journals
    Marlène Koffi
	
	 This paper investigates how women's works are perceived among their peers. I construct a dataset using bibliographic data from articles published in top journals in economics and granular information on the articles that cite them. I find that female-authored papers in top economic journals are (i) more likely to be cited outside economics, (ii) less likely to be cited by top-tier journals, and (iii) less likely to be cited by men. I conclude with a discussion on those results and their implications for females in economics. 

## Recognition for Group Work: Gender Differences in Academia
    Heather Sarsons
	
 How is credit for group work allocated when individual contributions are not observed? I use data on academics' publication records to test whether demographic traits like gender influence how credit is allocated under such uncertainty. While solo-authored papers send a clear signal about ability, coauthored papers are noisy, providing no specific information about each contributor's skills. I find that men are tenured at roughly the same rate regardless of coauthoring choices. Women, however, are less likely to receive tenure the more they coauthor. The result is much less pronounced among women who coauthor with other women.

eMENT mentoring workshop to support women in research careers.
The program was designed as a randomized controlled trial. This study evaluates differences
between the treatment and control groups in career outcomes. Results indicate that relative to
women in the control group, treated women are more likely to stay in academia and more likely
to have received tenure in an institution ranked in the top 30 or 50 in economics in the world


RK: thing not discussed in the paper: it is a single-sex workshop...




The CSWEP CeMENT workshop provides mentoring for women and nonbinary faculty in tenure-track positions at economics departments and similar institutions across North America. 
Participants are grouped with mentors based on research interests to discuss research projects and career goals. The program also features sessions on publishing, teaching, tenure preparation, grant writing, networking, and work/life balance.



## Facilitating return to the labour market with a novel CV format intervention
Research report 

displaying experience in terms of the number of years rather than dates led to a 4.8 percentage point (14.6%) increase in the positive callback rate.

It made no difference to the callback rate whether the gap was explained for childcare or left unexplained. Qualitative research finds that HR professionals express a preference for an explanation in interviews, but this does not translate to recruitment behaviour.

The difference in callback rates for CVs with and without gaps was not significant. These results do not replicate findings from previous studies in the unemployment literature and may be due to specific contextual factors of this trial. 


## Reducing discrimination against job seekers with and without employment gaps
Ariella S. Kristal, Leonie Nicks, Jamie L. Gloor & Oliver P. Hauser 


"Past research shows that decision-makers discriminate against applicants with career breaks. Career breaks are common due to caring responsibilities, especially for working mothers, thereby leaving job seekers with employment gaps on their résumés."

"Rewriting a résumé so that previously held jobs are listed with the number of years worked (instead of employment dates) increases callbacks from real employers compared to résumés without employment gaps by approximately 8%, and with employment gaps by 15%."
