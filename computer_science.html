<h1
id="additional-statistics-for-french-computer-science-academia">Additional
Statistics for french computer science academia</h1>
<p>We first provide a few statistics around gender bias in computer
science in French academia (so-called section 27 of the CNU), based on
publicly available data.</p>
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>significant efforts are required on the <strong>hiring
side</strong></li>
<li>there is a biased and probably <strong>unfair task
distribution</strong></li>
<li>their may be some <strong>specific pressure</strong> w.r.t.
productivity put on women during their thesis</li>
</ul>
<div class="warning">
<p><span style="color: #9a6700;">⚠ Warning</span></p>
<p>To discuss and reflect on those issues, it is crucial to consider
also the question of <strong>gender-based violence</strong>, which is
notably demonstrated to make women more likely to leave academia than
men, and is probably one of the biggest factor to fight against. This
page focuses on aggregating publicly available data, to make easily
available, and also show that other kind of statistical bias are present
and that actions at many different levels are required.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="hiring-practices">Hiring practices</h2>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>When considering the total population (MCF + PU), <strong>we are
stuck</strong> and not making any significant progress.</li>
<li>It is <strong>worse for more competitive positions</strong> (CR, DR,
PU), where we are way below the proportion of potential candidates.</li>
<li>There is only a slight improvement on the CNRS side, while CR INRIA
is worsening.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="pics/plot-positions.png" /></p>
<h2 id="bias-around-phd">Bias around PhD</h2>
<p>Highlights for people in section 27:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Men supervise more than women</strong> (about 1.5 times more
on average, and 60% of women don’t supervise vs 45% of men). The effect
holds for both PU or MCF.</li>
<li><strong>Women are more often jury member</strong> for thesis, but in
addition the global repartition whithin women is very bad, where a lot
of pressure is put on a few of them. The effect is most striking for PU,
but also holds for MCF.</li>
<li><strong>Women’s PhD thesis (in number of pages) are slightly
longer</strong> than men (on average 7 pages longer out of 180).</li>
</ul>
<div class="warning">
<p><span style="color: #9a6700;">⚠ Warning</span></p>
<p>This part is a self-made study, see <a
href="#methodology">Methodology</a> section below for limitations,
results are preliminary.</p>
</div>
<p>Effect 1 and 2 appear specific to section 27, and disappears when we
consider all jury members of computer science related thesis, thus
including international people/CNRS/INRIA. This means a specific
attention should be given to this in our universities: how are different
task distributed? Are some women asked and pushed to be in jury too
much? Are women teaching more than men, and left without time for
supervision? Are people with HdR offering to co-supervise with women
without HdR less than men without HdR?</p>
<p>Effect 3 may imply that explicit or implicit pressure is put on women
to produce more, to “make them prove that they belong”. More research
would be needed to explain this phenomenon, but we can still be on the
lookout for its consequences.</p>
<p>The plots below are density functions (the area below the lines sum
to 1). On the first one, we for instance see that way more women than
men in proportion never do any thesis jury (the red bar is bigger than
the purple one at 0), and that the last decile is way higher for women.
For each effect, we put the most striking graph first.</p>

<h1 id="hiring-committees-for-computer-science-and-maths">Hiring
committees for computer science and maths</h1>
<p>The french law for hiring committees enforces a 40% proportion of
women. So, as expected, we see an unfair burden on women. However,
across all sections, we observe <strong>an unfair repartition whitin
women</strong>, with too much pressure put on too few women. The effect
is most striking for PU in sec 25 and 26, and more reasonable for
section 27. However, note that for section 27, the results are very
innacurate (see <a href="#methodology">Methodology</a> below), almost
half of the data is missing, which could fully invisibilize the
targetted effect.</p>

<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<h3 id="mcfpu-positions">MCF/PU positions</h3>
<p>For MCF/PU positions, data was aggregated from the “Fiches
démographiques des sections du Conseil national des universités (CNU)”
for section 27, for INRIA, from the “Rapport Social Unique” 2022 and
2023, for CNRS, from “Rappor de conjoncture” 2018 and 2025.</p>
<h3 id="thesis">Thesis</h3>
<p>For PhD thesis gender/length/review/supervisions, data was scrapped
from <a href="https://theses.fr">theses.fr</a> and <a
href="https://theses.hal.science/">theses.hal.science/</a>, supported
with the electoral body of section 27 of 2019 and 2024 (which also
contains the gender). Some errors are very likely to be contained, but
for checkable data, data is consistent.</p>
<p>Notably, gender is mostly guessed using an INSEE database of name
popularity w.r.t. gender in France. For CNU 27 people, gender was
correctly guessed (comparing with the one from the electoral body) with
above 95% probability.</p>
<p>For linking a name from the electoral body listing to a theses.fr
identifier, we match by full name and use for homonyms the person with
the most activity as a link. For women that may take their husband names
upon mariage, we lose precision, and we notice that at the PU rank, we
don’t find matches for ~28% of PU women, vs ~15% for PU men (similar
accross sec 25,26,27). For PU in sec 27, we did a manual pass to match
more people, and reached a similar ratio as for men. This only affected
the bar at 0 of corresponding graphs, keeping the rest of the
distribution shape similar. At MCF rank, there is not significant
difference in loss between male/females.</p>
<p>A PhD thesis was considered to belong to section 27 if at least one
of the director is inside the section.</p>
<p>Several bias/limitations are present:</p>
<ul>
<li>gender is guessed and there is clearly room for error. In
particular, the error rate will be higher for names which are rare in
France.</li>
<li>the scrapped websites are not consolidated, and the link with
section 27 has to be made manually. E.g, domain is an arbitrary string
for theses.fr, theses.fr contains some redundant profile, and people
sometimes have a unique id identifier, sometimes not. Some people with
an id are not always linked to the id.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data would need to be manually inspected based on random sampling to
increase trust in the results. Some statistically significant bias would
require a quantitative analysis to identify the origin.</p>
<h3 id="hiring-committees">Hiring committees</h3>
<p>We used the electoral body of section 25,26 and 27 of 2019 and 2024,
which contains the gender. In addition, we used the grassroot effort of
registering committees at http://postes.smai.emath.fr</p>
<p>Note that in section 27, the proportion of unregistered committees
(for which we don’t know the set of committee members), is 52%, vs 8%
for 25 and 13% for 26. Hence, for section 27, the absolute value are
very much far away from the truth.</p>
<p>In addition, the committees member list are not at all formated in a
consistent way. For each cnu member, we counted how many time either
“firstname surname” or “surname firstname” occured in those
inconsistenly formatted lists. Many data points are probably missed, but
this should not introduce any gender bias.</p>
<h3 id="final-comments">Final comments</h3>
<p>For people willing to contribute to the exploration of potential
biases, all scripts used to build the databases and the databases
themselves can be found at
(https://github.com/not-in-our-labs/workpace/tree/main/?tab=readme-ov-file)
(in a messy state)</p>
<p>Additional questions to explore based on the available data:</p>
<ul>
<li>is there a bias w.r.t. cosupervisions?</li>
<li>is there a bias w.r.t. to thesis length in years?</li>
<li>is there a bias w.r.t. to unfinished thesis? (unclear if theses.fr
gives this data though)</li>
<li>?</li>
</ul>
